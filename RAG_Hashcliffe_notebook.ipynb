The system-defined  standard list view  groups the records under these categories: \\nFavorites: Any list view that you mark as favorite�\\nCreated By Me:  Custom views created by you (the user)�\\nYou cannot modify these default categories, but you can create custom list views � For example, you can \\ncreate an exclusive view for leads from a particular region or high profile contacts or deals of a certain \\namount�\\nSimilarly, you can create a Kanban view  to categorize your data into an organized card-based display. \\nThe benefit of this view lies in allowing the users to drag and drop the records from one category to \\nanother instead of editing them individually � For example, whenever a lead’s status is changed from \\n“attempted to contact” to “contact in future” you can simply drag and drop the lead to the appropriate \\ncategory instead of changing the status from the lead’s detail page�\\n\\n19\\nImplementing Zoho CRM for an SME\\nAll Layouts Layouts None Sort By Leads Details FILTER LEADS BY\\nCommunications\\n500,000.00\\nEmail Opt Out\\nINR\\nRudolph Scott\\n30,500,000.00   - 2 Deals\\nATTEMPTED TO CONTACT\\nCommunications\\n500,000,00\\nEmail Opt Out\\nINR\\nMark Snap\\n1,000,000.00\\nCONTACT IN FUTURE\\nManufacturing\\n30,000,000.00\\nEmail Opt Out\\nINR\\nCarrissa Meyer AddActivities\\nEmail Status\\nNotes\\nCampaigns\\nLast Name\\nCurrency\\nEmail Opt Out\\nIndustry\\nAnnual Revenue\\nCheckbox1\\nCityAll Leads\\nAnother view, called the Canvas view , will let you enhance the visual appeal of the record detail page by \\nintroducing background colors to the text, using fonts of your choice, highlighting texts, replacing regular \\nfield names with buttons, and more.\\nConsiderations Actions Resources\\nIs your business terminology \\ndifferent than Zoho CRM’s?Rename Leads module Rename tabs\\nAre the standard fields in the \\nLeads module enough to capture \\nyour business data?- Make a list of fields that you need which \\nare not covered by the standard fields  and \\nadd the custom fields to the layout.\\n- Edit the fields and values.Add custom fields\\nEdit fields\\nIs your database cluttered with \\ndifferent kinds of records?

              " Document(page_content='32\\nImplementing Zoho CRM for an SMEActivities that are likely to happen repeatedly in your business process can be automated to occur at a \\nparticular date and time or when certain conditions are satisfied. For example: \\nSending reminder emails to subscribers before their subscription end date\\nNotifying the regional sales managers whenever a deal worth $25,000 or more is createdMaking follow-up calls to your vendors every month\\nAssigning leads from cold calls to a specific rep\\nThis will help you reduce manual intervention and increase process efficiency. Here is a list of\\nautomation tools that you must configure before you get your customer data into CRM:Establish basic automation processes\\nAutomation tool Function\\nWorkflow rule Automate a set of actions like email notifications, field updates, record \\ncreation, tasks, and actions defined through functions, and webhooks by \\ncreating workflow rules.\\nAssignment rule Set a rule to assign leads with similar attributes to a particular rep�\\nCase escalation rule Help sales managers or their superiors stay on top of their projects by \\nnotifying them when a deadline is missed� \\nBring data into Zoho CRM\\nYou can now start importing data from external sources into your Zoho CRM account� Some of the\\nmethods that you can use to get data are:\\nData import: If your data is stored in different repositories, you must export it and in the\\nfile format that is supported in Zoho CRM before you can begin the import process� You can\\nimport data and notes to individual modules provided your data is accurate, doesn’t have\\nduplicate entries, and the field names are identifiable for field mapping. \\nMigrate data from other CRMs: If you are migrating from a different CRM, you can use the data \\nmigration wizard� We support migration from these CRM applications: Salesforce, MS Dynamics \\n365, Pipedrive, HubSpot, Insightly, and Highrise� You can see the progress of import from the \\nhistory and audit log �\\n\\n33\\nImplementing Zoho CRM for an SMESome points you must remember while importing data into CRM:\\nCreate assignment rules  to assign records to the appropriate owner before importing the\\nrecords� The assignment rule must be selected not just for import, but also for creating\\nwebforms, and pushing data via APIs�\\nRemember to select a unique field  during import. A unique field is unique for every record\\n(for example, email address, employee ID, or social security number)� If you select employee ID \\nas the unique field during import, CRM will look for other existing fields with the same value in \\nyour import sheet to identify duplicates� You can choose to skip duplicates, or clone or update \\nexisting records based on this unique field. \\nPushing data from APIs: In addition to from webforms, data import, and migration, Zoho provides REST \\nAPI support, which lets you integrate your CRM with any third-party application. For example, your field \\nagents use an application developed by your organization to collect clients’ data� You can integrate that \\napp with CRM to sync data between the systems and keep it up to date� In other words, whenever data is \\nadded to the app, it will be automatically added to CRM�\\nZoho CRM APIs follow REST standards with the OAuth2�0 method of authentication, and uses simple \\nHTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE, which makes it easier to develop new applications or \\nintegrate existing ones with CRM. APIs like “Insert Records” and “Upload Attachments” can be used to \\nadd record information or fis like text, image, video, etc.\\n\\n34\\nImplementing Zoho CRM for an SMEDetermine the business metrics you want to see\\nThe last step in your implementation process is to set up the system to reflect all the metrics that are \\ndefined in your business goals.\\nSample metrics to measure using reports and dashboards: \\nMetrics Report and dashboard type Resource\\n- Salesperson’s performance report.\\n- Number of leads converted\\n- Number of leads generated through\\ncampaigns\\n- View this month sales report\\n- Review a list of completed activities\\n- Number of unresolved casesSystem defined reports for \\nleads, activities, cases, and \\ndeals module� \\n(reports are available for all\\nmodules)Standard reports\\n- Number of deals owned by\\n“Jasmine Frank” in “Closed Won” stage \\nthat have a revenue greater than\\n$10,000 USD\\n- Status of cases from “Netherlands” that \\nreported “system failure”- Add these criteria to the\\nstandard report for deals \\nclosed this month\\n- Define region and type as\\ncriteria in the case status \\nreport�Customize the\\nstandard reports by \\ndefining criteria\\n- Product that was sold the most this \\nmonth\\n- Industry that purchased “X” applicationCreate custom reports with the \\nmetric of your choiceCustom reports\\n- Annual sales trend\\n- Monthly expenditure\\n- Quarterly enrollmentsGenerate reports on specific \\ndates automaticallySchedule reports\\n\\n35\\nImplementing Zoho CRM for an SMEMetrics Report and dashboard type Resource\\nMonthly and yearly sales targets achieved \\nby individualsTarget meter\\nAnalytical componentsIdentify sales trends and pinpoint unusual \\nbehaviorAnomaly detector\\nAnalyze team’s performance and draw \\ncomparison between data setsKey performance indicator and \\ncomparators\\nRepresent business metrics and\\ndistribution of data by stage graphicallyCharts and funnels\\nMetrics Report and dashboard type\\nThe metrics you want to measure The report or dashboard typeActivity sheet - List the metrics that you want to measure (Refer Appendix VIII and \\ndownload the complete activity sheet)\\n\\n36\\nImplementing Zoho CRM for an SMECongratulations!\\nYou have successfully implemented Zoho CRM for your business�\\nVisit our resources, help guides , ebooks, videos, and tutorials and join \\nthe community  to meet your fellow CRM users and continue this journey � \\nYou can also enroll for our training programs to learn more about Zoho \\nCRM in person from our product specialists�\\n\\n37\\nImplementing Zoho CRM for an SMEBusiness GoalsHow do you plan to achieve \\nthem?What to look for in CRMAppendix I� Enter your business goals�\\n\\n38\\nImplementing Zoho CRM for an SMEBusiness GoalsHow do you plan to achieve \\nthem?What to look for in CRM\\n\\n39\\nImplementing Zoho CRM for an SMESales stages Description Methods involvedAppendix II� Document your sales process\\n\\n40\\nImplementing Zoho CRM for an SMEProcess Step Analyze Appendix III� Enter the steps to analyze\\n\\n41\\nImplementing Zoho CRM for an SMESales stage Methods involved Mapped to CRM featureAppendix IV � Map your sales process\\n\\n42\\nImplementing Zoho CRM for an SMESales stage Methods involved Mapped to CRM feature\\n\\n43\\nImplementing Zoho CRM for an SMECRM terminology Business terminology  Appendix V � Map CRM terminologies with business terms\\n\\n44\\nImplementing Zoho CRM for an SMEPeople RoleAppendix VI� Identify the key players in your organization\\n\\n45\\nImplementing Zoho CRM for an SMEUsers RoleActions they will\\nperformCRM features \\nneededProfileAppendix VII.
